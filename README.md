A Monte Carlo Method for the Telegraph Equations

This package include the codes for all the examples from the paper:

Zhang, Bolong, Wenjian Yu, and Michael Mascagni. "Revisiting Kac's method: A Monte Carlo algorithm for solving the Telegrapher's equations." Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (2018).

The Python programs for the pictures in the Paper:

--fig5.py: Figure 5 in the paper

--fig6.py: Figure 6 in the paper

--fig7.py: Figure 7 in the paper

--fig8.py: Figure 8 in the paper

Note: All the problem contains a function using Algorthm1 from the paper

The code in the following shows the implementation for the Algorithm 2:
